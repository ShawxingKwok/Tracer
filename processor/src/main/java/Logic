first round
    1, check general usages
    2, build interfaces
    3, return symbols with Root/Nodes/Declare

before building props
    check usage of valid symbols with @Declare every round before building props.

    if it is second round
        fix interfaces for conflict of cognominal properties from different super interfaces.
        warn if some classes with @Root/Nodes don't implement their tracer interfaces.

    update invalid needed symbols, and build props if none

build props
    PropsBuilder:
        1, collect prop info when tracing
           meantime record and verify(require never validly trace inside reused elements)

        2, after the collection，build imports and srcTags for propInfo

        3，process collected prop info, make some declared with its owner name or prop name further.

        4, create files containing builtTimesComment

    In each PropInfo:
        1, lazily init typeContent, grossKey, propInfoNameCore, propInfoNames, references, declContents
        2, some inner type ksclasses are declared with their package names or srcTags.
