context:
Type: Generic, Alias, Specific, Compound, Arg
Arg: Simple, In, Out, Star
All these implement Convertible which has 'convertAlias', 'convertStar', 'convertGeneric', 'convertAll'

Note that `*` in an alias type would be shifted directly.
wait until the authority makes generic bounds in typealias obligatory.

1, for each ksType, cache its toProtoWithoutAliasAndStar

2, if it has any inner typeParameter, convert each to its converted bounds with generic name.
    (the association of typeParameter and converted bounds are cached)

3, associate its args and background typeParameters, and map to its klass's super types
    (cached and the inner aliases and stars are converted)
